Experimenting with WordPress

A ficticious company "Vakarau", meaning "set, ready, prepared" in Fijian, which I am building while I make my way through Brad Schiff's ["Become a WordPress Developer"](https://www.udemy.com/share/1003myBUcacFhaRHw=/). Brad Schiff has instantly become one of my favorite instructors on Udemy.  I highly recommend this course to any other developers needing to jump into WordPress.
